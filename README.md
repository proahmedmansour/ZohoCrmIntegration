# ZohoCrmIntegration
This is a simple project to show How to integrate with ZOHO CRM SDK and override the default URLs used by the SDK.

We faced an issue while publishing our application to the production environment because our server can not access the internet directily due to security reasones.

As a solution for that I created a custom data center class and you can override the apiBaseUrl and iamUrl.

Have a good coding :)
